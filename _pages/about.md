Hi, my name is Xiao Liu (刘潇). I am a first year master student in Computer Science at Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/). My major research interests include machine learning, knowledge graphs and data mining. 

Currently I am seeking for approaches to ***construct large-scale knowledge graphs in an unsupervised or self-supervised fashion*** (i.e., without human supervision). Constructing knowledge graphs have been a central challenge for decades in my field, and thanks to the boosting pre-trained models and self-supervised learning, this goal could be achieved soon.



<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
